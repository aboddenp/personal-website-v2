          <h2>ðŸš€ Road to Atlas 2</h2>
          <p>
            I maintained <strong>Atlas Free</strong> and <strong>Atlas Pro</strong>, two of the most popular HubSpot CMS
            themes for B2B SaaS. My role involved debugging user issues, implementing feature requests, and shipping
            updates to improve flexibility and maintainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            As usage grew, so did the friction. Our team decided to rebuild from the ground upâ€”<strong>Atlas 2</strong>
            â€”with a focus on developer ergonomics and marketing usability. Instead of dozens of rigid modules, we built
            a smaller set of <strong>highly configurable components</strong> with smart defaults and custom styling
            options.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key technical challenges was working around HubSpotâ€™s JSON-based module field limitations. We
            introduced a pattern for <strong>shared, centralized fields</strong> (like a global rich text config),
            allowing updates to cascade across all instancesâ€”improving consistency and maintainability.
          </p>
          <p>
            We prioritized performance from the start: the stack was pure <strong>HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS</strong>,
            with no frameworks or heavy dependencies. The only library used was <strong>Embla.js</strong> for
            lightweight slidersâ€”helping us keep the bundle lean and fast.
